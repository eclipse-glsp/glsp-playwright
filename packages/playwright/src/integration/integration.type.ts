         * The global namespace is used deliberately. `declare module '@eclipse-glsp/playwright'`
         * would *not* work: this interface is declared here and only re-exported by the package
         * barrel, and TypeScript cannot merge into a re-exported declaration — it would silently
         * create a new, unrelated interface instead.
